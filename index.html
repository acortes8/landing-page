            <div>Honey bees are social bees that are known for their populous hives that can exceed numbers of 60,000. They are native only to mainland Afro-Eurasia and were imported to the Americas long ago. They construct perennial colonies using wax they secrete, and produce a surplus of honey which they store in great quantity.</div>
            <img src="./images/bumble_bee.jpg" alt="Macro photo of a bumble bee.">
            <div>Bumble bees are large social bees that live in small colonies of around 50 individuals. They use their large size to create resonant vibrations, making them capable of <em>buzz pollination</em>. They construct their colonies underground usually, utilizing abandoned rodent burrows and similar settings.</div>
            <img src="./images/mason_bee.jpg" alt="Macro photo of a mason bee.">
            <div>Mason bees are small solitary bees that do not create colonies. They nest and forage only for themselves, and they cannot sting as they do not have stingers. They construct nests for themselves using mud and sand.</div>
            <img src="./images/leafcutter_bee.jpg" alt="Macro photo of a leafcutter bee.">
            <div>Leafcutter bees are small solitary bees that also do not create colonies. They share many characteristics and behaviors with mason bees. They have scissor-like jaws which they use to cut apart leaves and petals. They use these pieces to line their nests.</div>
